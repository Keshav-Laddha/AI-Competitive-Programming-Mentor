Why bcrypt + passlib?
❌ Why NOT store plain passwords?
If DB leaks → all users compromised.
❌ Why NOT SHA256?
Too fast → vulnerable to brute force.

✅ Why bcrypt?

Slow by design
Adaptive cost
Salted automatically
Industry standard
passlib wraps this safely.


3️⃣ JWT design decision (IMPORTANT)

We use JWT (JSON Web Token) because:
Stateless → no DB lookup per request
Scales well (10k+ users)
Easy to invalidate by expiry
Widely supported

JWT contains:
{
  "sub": "<user_id>",
  "exp": <expiry_timestamp>
}
That’s it. Minimal & safe.
