SQLAlchemy allows us to work with database without writing SQL code directly we can write python code, functions and SQLAlchemy handles all this

SQLAlchemy two parts
Core-> Database toolkit for python
ORM (Object Relational Mapper)-> we can create tables using python classes and use OOPS
rows as objects, tables as classes

ORM maps python classes to database tables
