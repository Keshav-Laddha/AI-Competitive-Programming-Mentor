What is PostgreSQL?
Relational Database (RDBMS): data in tables with rows & columns, strong schema.
Fully ACID-compliant → safe transactions (very important if later you track payments, submissions, ratings).
Very extensible: supports custom types, JSONB, full-text search, and pgvector for embeddings.



Why it’s a good choice for your CP Mentor app
Your data is highly relational:
Users → Submissions → Problems → Contests

Many-to-one and many-to-many relationships

You’ll need queries like:
“Give me all problems solved by user X in topic Y, sorted by difficulty, with stats aggregated”

Relational + strong SQL = PostgreSQL shines.


Why not MySQL?
MySQL is fine for simple CRUD, but:
PostgreSQL has better JSON, better indexing, richer SQL.
PostgreSQL has pgvector → store embeddings for recommendations & AI search.
For an interview, you can say:
“I chose PostgreSQL over MySQL because the project needs both relational modeling and AI-first capability via pgvector, and Postgres gives me both in one engine.”

Why not MongoDB?
MongoDB = NoSQL document store (JSON-like docs).
Good when your data is unstructured or schema-less.
Your data is actually structured (users, contests, tags, submissions).
Enforcing relationships and constraints is painful in Mongo.
So:
“MongoDB is great for flexible JSON-based workloads, but CP Mentor is naturally relational — I care about strong consistency, constraints, and complex joins, so PostgreSQL is a better fit.”

Why not SQLite?
SQLite is file-based, great for local/dev, small apps.
No real concurrency for high load, no user management, no extensions like pgvector in the same way.
For a real scalable SaaS-style app, you want PostgreSQL or MySQL.
